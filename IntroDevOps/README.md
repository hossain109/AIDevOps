## Traditional AI in DevOps
Traditional AI relies on structured data, pre-defined rules, and predictive models trained on historical data. It excels at classification, forecasting, and anomaly detection.
####
Example: Incident Detection & Prediction
    Use Case: Predicting system failures before they occur.
    How It Works:
        Uses log-based anomaly detection and pattern recognition (e.g., time-series forecasting).
        If CPU usage suddenly spikes beyond a threshold, AI predicts a potential issue.
        The system alerts DevOps teams to take preventive action.
    Limitations:
        Works only on pre-trained scenarios.
        Cannot generate insights beyond structured input data.
